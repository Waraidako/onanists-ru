Siento aqu√≠ tu presencia  
La noche de anoche  
Y nos ponemos a llorar

Yesterday, somebody whacked out my mural  
That energy'll make you niggas move to Europe  
But it's regular for me, yeah, that's for sure  
The love and hate is definite without a cure  
All this talk is bitch-made, that's on my Lord  
I'll kill 'em all before I let 'em kill my joy  
I done been through it all, what you endure?  
It used to be fuck that nigga, but now it's plural  
Fuck everybody, that's on my body  
My blick first then God got me  
I watch 'em pander with them back-handed compliments  
Put they head on a Cuban link as a monument  
I paid homage and I always mind my business  
I made the-  
I never lost who I am for a rap image  
It's motivation if you wonder how I did it

Yeah, nigga, go and up your rank  
Know you a god even when they say you ain't  
Yeah, nigga, keep your feelings out the way  
Never let no one put smut up on your name  
Yeah, nigga, keep your head down and work like I do  
But understand, everybody ain't gon' like you  
Yeah, nigga, if they say it's love, you've been lied to  
A couple rules of engagements, I'ma guide you

Que reflejan tu mirada  
La noche, t√∫ y yo

Ridin' in my GNX with Anita Baker in the tape deck  
It's gon' be a sweet love  
Fuck apologies, I wanna see y'all geeked up  
Don't acknowledge me then maybe we can say it's fair  
Take it to the internet and I'ma take it there  
Miss my uncle Lil' Mane, he said that he would kill me if I didn't make it  
Now I'm possessed by a spirit and they can't take it  
Used to bump Tha Carter III, I held my Rollie chain proud  
Irony, I think my hard work let Lil Wayne down

Whatever though, call me crazy, everybody questionable  
Turn me to an Eskimo, I drew the line and decimals  
Snoop posted Taylor Made, I prayed it was the edibles  
I couldn't believe it, it was only right for me to let it go  
Won the Super Bowl and Nas the only one congratulate me  
All these niggas agitated, I'm just glad they showin' they faces  
Quite frankly, plenty artists, but they outdated  
Old-ass flows, tryna convince me that you their favorite

This is not for lyricists, I swear it's not the sentiments  
Fuck a double entendre, I want y'all to feel this shit  
Old soul, bitch, I probably built them pyramids  
Ducking strays when I rap battled in the Nickersons  
Where you from? Not where I'm from, we all indigenous  
Against all odds, I squabbled up for them dividends  
Against all odds, I showed up as a gentleman  
I done lost plenty friends, sixteen to be specific  
Put that on my kids' children, we gon' see the future first  
They like, "Dot big trippin', " I just want what I deserve  
What bridge they done burnt? All of them, it's over with  
I'm doin' what COVID did, they'll never get over it

Yeah, nigga, go and up your rank  
Know you a god even when they say you ain't  
Yeah, nigga, keep your feelings out the way  
Never let no one put smut up on your name  
Yeah, nigga, keep your head down and work like I do  
But understand, everybody ain't gon' like you  
Yeah, nigga, if they say it's love, you've been lied to  
A couple rules of engagements here to guide you

Niggas from my city couldn't entertain old boy  
Promisin' bank transactions and even Bitcoin  
I never peaced it up, that shit don't sit well with me  
Before I take a truce, I'll take 'em to hell with me  
If that money got in the hands of a crash dummy  
Could jeopardize my family and burden the ones who love me  
Niggas mad 'cause I decided not to pretend  
Y'all stay politically correct, I'ma do what I did

Ain't no sympathy here, this shit's hilarious  
It's a lot of opinions but no power to carry it  
2025, they still movin' on some scary shit  
Tell 'em quit they job and pay the real niggas their severance  
Don't insult my intelligence, I'm not just for the television  
Teleport to Bullets Road and dig up all my relatives  
Okay, nigga, let's settle it, these niggas been fake loyal  
Since y'all pandering to choose a side, let me do it for you  
Okay, fuck your hip-hop, I watched the party just die  
Niggas cackling about- while all of y'all is on trial  
Niggas thought that I was antisocial when I stayed inside of my house  
You better off to have one woman, everything tricky right now

You niggas live in denial  
Ay, fuck anybody empathetic to the other side, I vow  
A bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with 'em in style  
Exterminate 'em right now  
Make Katt Williams and them proud, the truth 'bout to get loud  
No juice inside of my cup, I sober up and knock 'em all off  
Don't let no white comedian talk about no black woman, that's law  
I know propaganda work for them and fuck whoever that's close to them  
The niggas that coon, the niggas that bein' groomed, slide on both of them  
You ever ate Cap'n Crunch and proceeded to put water in it?  
Pulled over by the law, you ridin' dirty, so you can't argue with 'em?  
Then make it to be a star, bare your soul and put your heart up in it? Well, I did  
Whacked the murals out but it ain't no legends if my legend ends
